# A number is prime if it is not divisible by any smaller primes.
# I know that the first primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.
# I wonder if 13 is prime?
n = 13
divisible = (n%2==0) or (n%3==0) or (n%5==0) or (n%7==0) or (n%11==0)
answer = not divisible
print("Is 13 prime: " + str(answer))

# So 13 is prime.  What about 15?
n=15
divisible = (n%2==0) or (n%3==0) or (n%5==0) or (n%7==0) or (n%11==0)
answer = not divisible
print("Is 15 prime: " + str(answer) )# Edit this line
